# ID-Card-Scanner-Software

![stand_functional](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6cc745d-cd59-48f8-842c-89c26c747f81)

<p>Worked in a team to develop an <b>ID card scanning system</b> designed to manage and secure access for dormitory visitors. My main responsibility was <b>software development</b>, focusing on automation, data extraction, and user interaction.</p>

<p>The system detected ID cards, extracted personal data using <b>Python and PyTesseract</b>, and automatically registered visitor and room information. It also provided <b>real-time feedback</b> through LEDs and a graphical interface, improving usability.</p>

<p>Hardware components included a <b>Raspberry Pi, distance sensor, servomotor, and LED indicators</b>, all integrated through custom control scripts. The software was developed using <b>object-oriented programming (OOP)</b> principles and featured a <b>database</b> for storing visitor records and access logs.</p>

<p>The result was a <b>fully functional system</b> that simplified visitor registration, improved security, and enhanced the efficiency of dorm access management. Through this project, I gained significant experience in <b>automation, image processing,</b> and <b>hardware–software integration.</b></p>
